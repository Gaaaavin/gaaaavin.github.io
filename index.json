Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from New York University and NYU Shanghai.\nMy research interest lies in the intersection of computer vision and robot perception. In my research, I aim to develop large reconstruction models to build digital twins of the real-world, foundational world models that simulate dynamic environments, and generalist policy models based on model predictive control.\nðŸ”¥ News [2025-02] Iâ€™ll be joining waymo as a intern in summer 2025.\n[2025-02] CityWalker is accepted to CVPR 2025.
