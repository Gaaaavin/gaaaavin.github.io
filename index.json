Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from New York University and NYU Shanghai.\nMy research aims to build embodied AI systems with human-like spatial intelligence, enabling it to operate safely and effectively in complex, real-world environments. Key topics include: Dual-System architectures that unify fast reaction with deliberate planning, using MLLMs for Spatial Reasoning, and creating interactive Digital Twins for robust simulation and training.\n🔥 News [2025-02] I’ll be joining Waymo as a intern in summer 2025.\n[2025-02] CityWalker is accepted to CVPR 2025. See you in Nashville!\n[2024-10] TF-VPR is accepted to IEEE RA-L.\n[2024-09] MSG is accepted to NeurIPS 2024.\n[2024-07] Occ4cast and SSCBench are accepted to IROS 2024.\n📣 I\u0026#39;m always happy to collaborate with self-motivated UG/MS student on my exciting research projects.
