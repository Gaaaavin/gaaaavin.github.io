I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at NYU [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/), advised by
Prof. [Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng). 
Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. degree from [New York University](https://nyu.edu/) and
[NYU Shanghai](https://nyu.edu/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of **computer vision** and **robot perception**.
More specifically, I'm interested in how autonomous agents *perceive*, *forecast*, and *plan* in complex 3D environments through vision.
